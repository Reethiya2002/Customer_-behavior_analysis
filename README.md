1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas

Inspected structure, datatypes, missing values

Exported cleaned/intermediate datasets when needed

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis

Correlation checks

Key patterns and outliers identification

3. Data Cleaning

Handling null values

Standardizing formats (dates, numbers, categories)

Removing duplicates

Feature engineering (if applicable)

4. SQL Analysis

Performed additional analysis using SQL queries in PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server, including:

Joins

Aggregations

Window functions (if used)

Filtering and grouping for deeper insights

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected cleaned dataset to Power BI

Created interactive visuals:

KPIs

Bars/lines/charts

Filters and slicers

Designed a user-friendly, business-oriented dashboard layout

6. Final Report & Presentation

Summarized insights in a clean, concise report

Created a professional slide deck using Gamma for presentation-ready storytelling
